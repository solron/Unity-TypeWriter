<h3>Typewriter effect in Unity</h3>

As the script is now the text will be display at the middle. But can easily modified to start on the left side.
This code shows how to use it as a terminal with C64 font and C64 color theme. With a change of background and font, you should be able to mimic a typewriter. 

The text displayed are limited to lower case english alphabet. This is because of the font sprite sheet I made. You can easily modify this too.
